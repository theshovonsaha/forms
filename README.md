# Form Validation Project

## Overview

This project implements a modern, accessible form validation system using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and semantic HTML. It demonstrates best practices in web development, focusing on user experience, accessibility, and maintainability.

## My Approach & Thought Process

### 1. Starting with HTML

I began with semantic HTML because it forms the foundation of accessibility and SEO. I chose to use:

- `<form>` with `novalidate` to implement custom validation
- Proper `label` associations with inputs
- ARIA attributes for screen reader support
- Error message containers with appropriate roles

The goal was to create a structure that works even if CSS or JavaScript fails to load.

### 2. CSS Strategy

For styling, I followed a mobile-first approach with these priorities:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Immediate user feedback
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Smooth transitions for interactions
- Accessible color contrasts

I used modern CSS features while ensuring broad browser support. The styles are organized from general to specific, making them easy to maintain and modify.

### 3. JavaScript Implementation

The validation system was built with several key considerations:

- Real-time validation feedback as users type and when fields lose focus
- Clear error messages
- Password strength visualization
- Form state management
- Efficient event handling

I chose to use vanilla JavaScript instead of a framework because:

1. It demonstrates core JavaScript understanding
2. Keeps the bundle size minimal
3. No external dependencies
4. Better performance for this assignment

### 4. Key Features

#### Accessibility

- Screen reader support (aria-live)
- Keyboard navigation (tabindex)
- ARIA attributes for form elements
- Clear error states (aria-invalid)
- Proper focus management (tabindex)

#### User Experience

- Real-time validation as users type and onBlur
- Password strength indicator
- Clear visual feedback
- Responsive design

## Technical Decisions

### Why Vanilla JS?

I chose vanilla JavaScript over a framework/library because:

- The scope didn't justify the overhead of a framework
- Better learning opportunity for understanding core concepts
- Easier to maintain and modify
- No dependency management needed

### CSS Architecture

The CSS follows a component-based structure, making it:

- Easy to modify individual components
- Simple to maintain
- Scalable for larger applications
- Clear in its purpose

### Form Validation Strategy

I implemented a hybrid approach to validation:

- Client-side for immediate user feedback
- Prepared for server-side validation
- Real-time password strength checking
- Comprehensive error messaging

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for validation logic
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Convert into a standalone validation service that can be implemented across different frameworks and applications

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
